# Landing-Distance-Analysis
This project analyzes the factors impact the landing distance of an aircraft. Linear regression was used to create the final model.

The steps followed in this projected to analyze landing distance are:
- Data Cleaning
  1. Identify the duplicate observations
  2. Identify outlier observations and treat them

- Exploratory Data Analysis
  1. Univariate analysis: To understand the distribution
  2. Bivariate analysis : To graphically understand the distance between landing distance and all factors
  3. Correlation        : To quantify the relationship between landing distance and other factors
  
- Single factor regression
  1. On non-standardized variables: To check the significance of each variable
  2. Standardized variables       : To check the impact of each variable on landing distance

- Linear regression
  1. Create the base model with all the variables
  2. Identify if there is collinearity among variables; If so, remove the less important variable
  3. Reduce the model using step function
  4. Plot residual diagnostics
  5. Present key model results

## Key concepts: 
Data cleaning, EDA, Correlation, Regression, Code Automation
